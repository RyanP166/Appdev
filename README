# this is the first version
This project is to turn a Raspberry PI as an audio device.The
device is able to do 2 functions: as a sound collector and as a
test-tone generator.

---1.Configuration Instructions

        The application is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.This Pi should come with a USB sound card, a network 
        connection, a microphone.

        1.1 16gb Micro sd card has instaled Raspbian operating system.

        1.2 USB audio card configurates as default audio device for Raspberry Pi onboard
            the sound Card does not have a microphone interface. Then use "lsusb" command to 
            check if your USB sound card is mounted, it should show message below:
	    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0d8c:000c C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter.
            
            + Use "sudo nano /etc/asound.conf" command and put the following content into the file:
	        pcm.!default {
	        type plug
	        slave {
		          pcm "hw:1,0"
	              }
	        }
	        ctl.!default {
		          type hw
		          card 1
	        }
        
            + Use "nano .asoundrc" command and put the same content into the file.
        
            + Run "alsamixer" to check whether the USB sound card is the default audio device.
        
---2.Installation Instructions

        -  Download Raspbian OS from  this website :https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/ and install it.
        
        - For the first time boot, plug in your keyboard, mouse and monitor cable. Then, you disable a display with RPi
          because it will be more convinient and you don't use it in most cases. Furthermore, you also need to know its IP address
          when using RPi remotely. For more information about NOOBS setup, you can find at: https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/

        - Disassemble keyboard, mouse and monitor cable and plug them back in your computer.Then, insert USB sound card and microphone
          to the Raspberry Pi and connect RPi to a Internet domain by the RJ45 cable. After that, connect to power supply by Micro USB to USB cable.

        - Using IP address sent by email to connect to the terminal.
        
        - Installing library Libcurl (a reliable and portable library providing an easy interface):
                + Use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify
                  that libcurl library is installed.
	
	        + Run "sudo apt-get update” to update the application list (IF THE FOLDER DOES NOT EXITS).
	
	        + Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
	
	        + Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.

---3.Operating Instructions

        - Open the PUTTY and logging in your IP address you recieved via your email. "login as:" pi and enter your password.
        
        - There are some useful commands you need to know to easily get access to those file:
                + "mkdir": Make a new folder
                + "ls -l": show the files of current folder in details
                + "cd..": Change to parent folder
                + "cd $HOME": Change to the root folder of current user
                + "rm": Delete a file or a number of files/folders
                + "scp": Copy files from one host to another host
                Access to: "http://www.circuitbasics.com/useful-raspberry-pi-commands/" for more informations
             
        - First using "make" command to generate .o file type
	
	- There are 2 features of this program:
        
		+ Run "./sound.out" to collect the sound.
		+ Run "./sound.out frequency", for example, "./sound.out 440", then you are able to select 
                  between 1 or 2 (mono or stereo) and choose the duration from 1 to 10.
